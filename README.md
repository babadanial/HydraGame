Welcome!
This repository contains the contents of the HydraGame project written by Daniel Akbarzadeh.

### Project Files
This folder contains the implementations and interface files of all the classes that make up the final executable, as well as a client that handles inputs (game commands). 

A Makefile is also included to allow easy compilation of the project. This Makefile provides many debugging-friendly flags to the compiler so as to allow extensive debugging of the program in GDB, as well as memory leak and other checks using Valgrind.
